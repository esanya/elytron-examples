    <head><title>WildFly client default SSLContext provider</title></head>

    <body>
    	<p>
    	  This example demonstrates how WildFlyClientDefaultSSLContextProvider can be used to register JVM wide default SSLContext.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	 There is no user interface for this quickstart.
         Instead, you can verify the REST endpoint is up and running by accessing the following URL:
         </p>
         <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
         <a href="rest/hello">rest/hello</a>
         </div>
         <p>
          This URL will prompt you to accept server's certificate and provide client's certificate. Run test from the client module associated with this example to see that WildFlyClientDefaultSSLContextProvider was used to provide default SSLContext to the client.
    	</p>
